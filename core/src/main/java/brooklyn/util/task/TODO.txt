ALEX - SOON
- javadoc
- tags instead of buckets, stored on the tag
- record status in task (PRE_SUBMISSION, SUBMITTED_NOT_STARTED, RUNNING, BLOCKED_BY_TASK, SUCCEEDED, ERROR, CANCELLED)
- blocking, synchronize conveniences (tied in with status)

DAN - SOON
- sequential, parallel tasks
- Set<Task> containedIn, field in Task

THEN
- replace execution elsewhere in code with use of ExecutionContext
- expiry (removal) of completed tasks (currently everything is kept)
- better task type hierarchy (interface, finals, etc)
- task serialization, proxying (so remote can find out when source is finished)
