TODO (DAN)
- sequential, parallel tasks
- Set<Task> containedIn, field in Task

TODO
- replace execution elsewhere in code with use of ExecutionContext (much done)
- schedule (as in JBossNode, TomcatNode)

- expiry (removal) of completed tasks (currently everything is kept)
- better task type hierarchy (interface, finals, etc)
- task serialization, proxying (so remote can find out when source is finished)
